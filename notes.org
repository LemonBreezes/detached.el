* Improvements
** Support byte compilation
** Handling large files

Opening a large file yields the following warning.

#+begin_src text
  Warning (undo): Buffer ‘*dtache*’ undo info was 219405582 bytes long.
  The undo info was discarded because it exceeded `undo-outer-limit'.

  This is normal if you executed a command that made a huge change
  to the buffer.  In that case, to prevent similar problems in the
  future, set `undo-outer-limit' to a value that is large enough to
  cover the maximum size of normal changes you expect a single
  command to make, but not so large that it might exceed the
  maximum memory allotted to Emacs.

  If you did not execute any such command, the situation is
  probably due to a bug and you should report it.

  You can disable the popping up of this buffer by adding the entry
  (undo discard-info) to the user option `warning-suppress-types',
  which is defined in the `warnings' library.
