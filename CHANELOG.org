* Development

- Fix error in =dtache-env= usage. The integration wasn't correct which resulted in =dtache= failing to execute some commands properly
- Make =dtache-env= optional rather than required. =Dtache= should be fine without it, just that automatic status labeling will not be run

* Version 0.1 (2021-12-15)

- Initial release
