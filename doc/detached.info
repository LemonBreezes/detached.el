1 Overview
**********

The ‘detached’ package allows Emacs to run processes which are
independent from Emacs itself.  This is accomplished by offloading the
process creation to the program ‘dtach’.

   The package introduces a concept of a detached session.  A session
constitues of three parts:

   • a dtach process
   • a log with all the process output
   • a datastructure in Emacs-Lisp

   After a session has been created, Emacs can optionally attach to the
process.  This is something that can be done seemlessly and therefore
provides no dissruption in the ordinary workflows.  Another feature
provided by the package is its monitoring of sessions.  It will notify
the user whenever a session transitions from active to inactive.  Since
all the output of the session is captured, and stored persistently, it
can be thought of as a text representation of the process.

   The package provides integration with the following built-in Emacs
packages:

   • ‘compile’
   • ‘dired’
   • ‘eshell’
   • ‘org’

   It also offers support for some 3rd-party packages.  For a full list
of all supported packages, see the variable
‘detached-init-package-integration’.

2 Dependencies
**************

The package has no dependencies to other Emacs packages.  The
requirements are that it needs to run on either ‘Linux’ or ‘macOS,’
since those are the operating systems supported by the program ‘dtach’.
Apart from dtach, the complete list of external tools to get all the
features from the package are:

   • ‘tail’
   • ‘script’
   • ‘grep’

3 Installation
**************

The ‘detached’ package can be installed from ‘GNU ELPA’ which is enabled
by default.  It is also available for installation through the ‘Guix’
package manager.

4 Configuration
***************

This is a a minimal ‘use-package’ configuration.

     (use-package detached
       :init
       (detached-init)
       :bind (([remap async-shell-command] . detached-shell-command)
              ([remap compile] . detached-compile)
              ([remap recompile] . detached-compile-recompile))
       :custom ((detached-terminal-data-command system-type)
                (detached-terminal-data-command system-type)))

File: detached.info,  Node: Notifications,  Next: Detached list,  Up: Customization

5.1 Notifications
=================

By default ‘detached’ uses the built in ‘notifications’ library to issue
notifications to the user.  This solution is dependent on ‘dbus’, and if
that doesn’t work the user has the posbility to customize the
‘detached-notification-function’.

   The variable can be changed to:
   • a custom function, created by the user
   • the ‘detached-state-transition-echo-message’, which uses the echo
     area
   • the ‘detached-extra-alert-notification’, which relies on the
     3rd-party package ‘alert’


File: detached.info,  Node: Detached list,  Prev: Notifications,  Up: Customization

5.2 Detached list
=================

The buffer created by ‘detached-list-sessions’ can be customized in its
appearance.  This is done through the
‘detached-list-display-buffer-action’.  By default it will use:

     '(display-buffer-same-window
       (inhibit-same-window . nil))

   Which makes the buffer replace the buffer in the current window.  For
those that prefer a popup window, created at the bottom of the frame,
the following value can be used:

     '(display-buffer-at-bottom
       (window-height . 0.33))

File: detached.info,  Node: Session creation,  Next: Session initialization,  Up: Sessions

6.1.1 Session creation
----------------------

When creating a session ‘three actions’ are taken:
   • The session’s directory is getting watched, unless its already
     watched
   • A timer-based validator function is being created
   • The session object is added to the list of unvalidated sessions

   The steps taken above is done in order to handle a couple of
different scenarios:
   • The underlying ‘dtach’ session is never created, the validator will
     recognize this and never insert the session into the database
   • The session is correctly created and is running when the validator
     is called, it will update the state from ‘unknown’ to ‘active’ and
     insert the object into the database
   • The session is finished quickly before the validator is being run,
     it will trigger a session directory event, this will update the
     session and insert it into the database, at the same time it is
     removed from the list of ‘unvalidated’ sessions which will cause
     the ‘validator’ to not do anything

   The logic described mean that the Emacs that creates the session is
responsible for validating the session.  Only when a session has been
validated, or become inactive, it will be added to the database.  When
it is added to the database it will cause other ‘Emacsen’ to read from
the database and then become aware of existence the session.

6.1.2 Session initialization
----------------------------

The initialization of ‘sessions’ when ‘detached’ is loaded is performed
in the following steps:
   • All known sessions are read from the database
   • The directory where the database resides are being watched in order
     to detect updates made to the database
   • A hash-table is created where all keys are session ids, and the
     values are the status, which is initialized to ‘uninitialized’
   • For all sessions that are accessible, which is either local
     sessions or remote sessions with an active connection
        • The hash-table is updated to ‘initialized’
        • The sessions ‘initialized-emacsen’ property is updated with
          the process id of the current Emacs
        • If the session is registered as ‘active’ the session is
          updated if it has transitioned to ‘inactive’, otherwise its
          session directory is being watched
        • If the session is missing, ‘e.g.’ it has been deleted from the
          computer, the session is removed from the database


File: detached.info,  Node: Session transition,  Prev: Session initialization,  Up: Sessions

6.1.3 Session transition
------------------------

The ‘detached’ sessions are read from the persistent ‘detached.db’ file
when the package is loaded.  All ‘Emacsen’ that loads ‘detached’ are
reading and writing to the same database file, that allows the sessions
to be shared among Emacsen.

   To avoid all Emacsen from sending a notification when a session
becomes inactive the responsibility is determined dynamically.  All
Emacsen, where detached is loaded, registers their process in a file
named ‘detached-emacsen’.  Initialization of sessions are done on a
session basis

7 Known limitations
*******************

The ‘detached’ package have some known limitations.  It is designed
around the idea that a single command is executed.  Therefore it does
not support a session that can be re-used over time, which is a common
use-case with for example ‘tmux’.

* Reproducible environments::


File: detached.info,  Node: Quotation marks,  Next: Reproducible environments,  Up: Known limitations

7.1 Quotation marks
===================

The way the package transforms, the command the user wants to run, into
a ‘detached’ command behaves incorrectly when it contain double qutation
marks.  For example the following command:

     git shortlog --summary --numbered --all --no-merges --since="01 Jan 2022"

   Will unfortunatelly not be interpreted correctly.  Instead the user
needs to use single quation marks in order for it to work:

     git shortlog --summary --numbered --all --no-merges --since='01 Jan 2022'


File: detached.info,  Node: Reproducible environments,  Prev: Quotation marks,  Up: Known limitations

7.2 Reproducible environments
=============================

The package works best when sessions can be re-run.  For this to work,
the command needs to be robust against changes in the environment.
Since only a single command is run there can be no dependency to
previously run commands in the same shell, when the session is created.
If the command the user wants to run have such requirements the best
thing to do is to create a shell script that can set up that
environment, and execute that script instead.

   The tool ‘direnv’ could ideally be used with ‘detached’, however
there seems to be no way to make it work for remote processes.  So the
recommendation for that use-case is the same as above, create a shell
script.  For example a script named ‘direnv_command’ with the following
content:

     #!/usr/bin/env bash
     direnv exec . "$@"

   Then the following command would be reproducible.

     direnv_command python foo.py

9.2 Idea contributors
=====================

   • rosetail (https://gitlab.com/rosetail) for all the great ideas and
     improvements to the package.  Without those contributions
     ‘detached.el‘ would be a less sophisticated package.
   • Troy de Freitas (https://gitlab.com/ntdef) for solving the problem
     of getting ‘detached.el‘ to work with ‘filenotify‘ on macOS.
   • Daniel Mendler (https://gitlab.com/minad) for helping out in
     improving ‘detached.el‘, among other things integration with other
     packages such as ‘embark‘ and ‘consult‘.
   • Ambrevar (https://gitlab.com/ambrevar) who indirectly contributed
     by inspiring me with his yes eshell is my main shell
     (https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6y3q4k/yes_eshell_is_my_main_shell/).
     It was through that I discovered his package-eshell-detach
     (https://github.com/Ambrevar/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/lisp/package-eshell-detach.el)
     which got me into the idea of using ‘dtach‘ as a base for detached
     shell commands.
